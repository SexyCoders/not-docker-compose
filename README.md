# not-docker-compose

<b>not-docker-compose</b> allows you to collectivelly or individually manage all aspects of a docker environment, such as containers, networks, images, swarms etc.

<b>not-docker-compose</b>, is a solution, that - big shock coming up! -:
- respects all unix practices and almost always follows posix
- is written in plain old bash - <b>NO</b> requirements - 100% compatibility
- works with both simple text files, as well as JSON (requires jq) 

:warning: <b>please use bash version > 4</b>
